As a side project I've built an Electon App for [Montessori Northwest](https://montessori-nw.org) training center to help them sync data between platforms.

## What It Does

- Queries Populi's REST API to lookup updated contacts from the last synchronization.
- Updates the contacts in MailChimp's API.
