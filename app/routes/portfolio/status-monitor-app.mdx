I built a status monitor app to send alert notifications when a
successful "ping" isn't received within a specified interval of time.

It is useful when you have hundreds of automated reports and processes
and can't afford to be the last one to know that it has stopped working.

Use your API key to post JSON to the endpoint: `https://status-monitor.app/api/ping`.

```bash
curl -d '{"name": "Test Ping","groupName": "Test Group","details": "Some test info with **markdown** formatting.","interval": 10,"apiKey": "**APIKEY HERE**","progressBar": 33,"success": true,"emails": ["example@fakeemail.com"]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://status-monitor.app/api/ping
```
