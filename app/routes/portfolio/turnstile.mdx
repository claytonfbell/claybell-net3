A couple years ago, I was tasked with integrating our platform with this turnstile hardware for a client in Texas. Visitors bring their paper or mobile ticket to the barcode reader on the turnstile, it sends a request to our application to validate.

The client already ordered the hardware through a vendor just weeks before their opening.

In order to be compatible, I had to write a SOAP interface without having access to the turnstile hardware that would use it. It had to function exactly to spec, otherwise it would fail. I wrote software to simulate a turnstile following the hardware company's documentation.

I reorganized our existing scanning application into a library that was packaged with the new local server application.

Upon completion, I shipped this Surface Pro loaded with the new application to our client in Texas. I included A case, accessories, and some quick-setup documentation.
When they arrived, the hardware vendor onsite entered some settings on the turnstiles and it .....worked!
